# **About Me**

Hi I am Vineet :wave:,<br>
I recently graduated with a PhD in Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering from Arizona State University, where I was advised by Dr. Gautam Dasarathy. My research focused on statistical machine learning, statistics, and signal processing, with a strong emphasis on developing innovative and data-efficient approaches to complex data analysis problems.

In my downtime I enjoy listening to audiobooks and hiking. 

I am always interested to talk about current and upcoming trends in machine learning research. Feel free to write to me or <!-- Calendly link widget begin --><link href="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" type="text/javascript" async></script><a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/vineetgattani'});return false;">schedule a time</a><!-- Calendly link widget end --> to chat briefly.
