# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ Vineet Gattani }}** :wave:,<br>
Iâ€™m a fourth year PhD student in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University advised by Dr. Gautam Dasarathy. My research interests include statitical machine learning, online learning and high-dimensional statistics. 

In my downtime I enjoy listening to audiobooks, hiking and spending time with my dog.
