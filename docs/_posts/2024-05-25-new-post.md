We are only given a small labelling budget $M$  ($< N$), we employ the technique presented in [Yilmaz et.al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12043.pdf) to sample data points which contribute more to any given test statistic. There are two sampling approaches presented in the above paper, currently we focus on using the importance sampling approach. In short, the importance sampling approach samples those points which contribute more to the squared error between the finite $  M$ estimator $\hat{F}$ and infinite $M$ limit $F^\prime.$ Clearly, we do not have access to the true underlying posterior distribution, to mitigate this the paper suggests approximations.
